# owasm-ethereum

Collection of externs to interact with an Ethereum-like network.

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/owasm-ethereum)

[Oasis Labs Tutorials](https://docs.oasiscloud.io/) - tutorials on how to write contracts in Webassembly for the Oasis Devnet and other WASM-enabled networks.

This crate is forked from [paritytech/pwasm-ethereum](https://github.com/paritytech/pwasm-ethereum).

We are big fans of the work [Parity](https://www.parity.io/) is doing to advance the state of Ethereum and smart contract development. In order to further experiment with new features including new opcodes and gas models, we have forked these repositories.

In the spirit of open-source, we intend to contribute bug fixes and new features upstream and will make our changes available to the community.
